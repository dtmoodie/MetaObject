# MetaObject

MetaObject is a reflection library that sits ontop of Runtime Compiled C++.

MetaObject provides the following features:

1) Static and dynamic introspection of object parameters

2) Static and dynamic introspection of object signals / slots

3) Serialization of parameters

All objects created with the appropriate macros and inheritance from IMetaObject are runtime modifiable classes.

A quick example program using MetaObject can be found in the examples/console_reflection folder
